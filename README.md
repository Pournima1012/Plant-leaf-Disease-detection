# Plant-leaf-Disease-detection

This project implements a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and classify diseases in plant leaves from images. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying crop diseases early to prevent major losses.
